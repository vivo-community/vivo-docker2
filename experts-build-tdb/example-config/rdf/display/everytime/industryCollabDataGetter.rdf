           		&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.colorado.edu/industry/"&gt;The Office of Industry Collaboration&lt;/a&gt; promotes and supports synergistic opportunities
                for engagement between CU Boulder and industry and business. Strengthening these connections
                provides benefits to partners, students, and local, state, and national economies. 

                &lt;p&gt;The Industry office provides an identified point of contact to connect business to the
                        services, expertise, and capabilities available at CU Boulder in support of operational
                        goals. Following the connection and determination of mutual interest, the Industry office
                        remains engaged to proficiently propel the project forward through contracting,
                        implementation, delivery, and close-out. In addition, the Industry office supports
                        CU Researchers who have made connections with industry partners and are ready to
                        progress.  Industry may contact the departments directly or through the Industry office for a broader dissemination of information and identification of potential connections.&lt;/p&gt;</j.1:htmlValue>
